# tf-Metasurface_Optimization
Optimization of single-element metasurface parameters using tensorflow and ~5600 Lumerical simulations as training data. Simulations performed under normally incident light. The features that define metasurface are the 1) length 2) width 3) height 4) x-direction periodicity 5) y-direction periodicity. The output is the phase spectrum across the visible at increments of 5 nm
